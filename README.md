Vibe - a simple roguelike text game. Written in Python/libtcod

Made by Tyler Sutton

This project is very much a work in progress. I'm currently following the code from this tutorial --> http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/
Currently, most if not all of the code in the project is directly from this tutorial. I do not intend to take any credit or blame for the quality of the code in its current state.

I have big(ish) plans for this eventually but for now there's not much to see.
